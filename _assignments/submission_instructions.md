You will need to submit the following files in a *zip* archive via Compass:

+ mpN.html

+ mpN.js

+ You can use any naming convention you wish for additional JS you author and use (e.g. Terrain.js or Sphere.js, etc.)

In the file name, replace N with the number of the MP (e.g. MP1.html). You should also include any additional files you use or have written. In particular you can use the
glMatrix library gl-matrix-min.js.

Name your submission as  NETID_MPN.zip and submit it to Compass, where  NETID is your netid and N is the MP number. This MP (as are the other MP's) is more than just an assignment for a grade to verify graphics programming proficiency. It is also an opportunity to impress me, your friends/family and your future employer or graduate school.
